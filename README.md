A machine learning project that uses the 'Hello World' of datasets:

[The Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)

Agenda:
1. Define Problem.
1. Prepare Data.
1. Evaluate Algorithms.
1. Improve Results.
1. Present Results.


The best way to really come to terms with a new platform or tool is to
work through a machine learning project end-to-end and cover the key steps. 
Namely, from loading data, summarizing data, evaluating algorithms and 
making some predictions.

If you can do that, you have a template that you can use on dataset after 
dataset. You can fill in the gaps such as further data preparation and 
improving result tasks later, once you have more confidence.
